    In this conversation, you asked for help in building a website where you could input a list of items, and the website would generate URLs for various stores that include those items in their search queries. You provided a sample URL for Aldi as a starting point.

    I provided you with the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code necessary to create a basic website that achieved your goal. We iterated on the design and functionality of the website based on your feedback, making the following changes:

    Added the functionality to open all the generated links with a single click.
    Changed the generated links to buttons with store-specific labels.
    Made further adjustments to the buttons, replacing the text with emojis.
    Added more stores to the list: Coop, Migros, K-Tipp, Galaxus, and Saldo.
    Created an "Open All" button for each item and for each store.
    Implemented a card-based flat design for the website.
    Replaced emojis with favicons for each store's button.
    Allowed prepopulating items during the page load via URL parameters.
    Throughout the conversation, I provided you with the necessary code snippets and explained how the changes would impact the website's functionality. In the end, you shared the updated favicon URLs for the stores, and I acknowledged the changes.
